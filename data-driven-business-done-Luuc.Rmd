## What features define a data driven business?

A data driven business is more than just installing the right tools and applications, becoming data-driven is about making data and analytics part of the business strategy, its systems, processes and culture. (Delaware, 2021)

When a company employs a “data-driven” approach, it means it makes strategic decisions based on data analysis and interpretation. A data-driven approach enables companies to examine and organise their data with the goal of better serving their customers and consumers. By using data to drive its actions, an organisation can contextualise and/or personalise its messaging to its prospects and customers for a more customer-centric approach. (atinternet, 2021)

So a data driven business is defined by certain features such as the stragic decision based on data analysis and interperetation. The organization of the data and of course the quality of the data. When companies combine these features they should be right up there in the business strategy of the company which is ultimately controbuting towards a more customer-centric approach.

Leaders inspire through action, basing decisions on data, not intuition.
